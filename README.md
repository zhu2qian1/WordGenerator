# WordGenerator
A work-in-progress stuff that is not expected to be used by others.

I've just started to work on it since September, 2020 because I thought consciously defining the phonetical structure of words will definitely help me have deep insight regarding generative phonology.

...Plus I simply wanted to try out my skill of coding in Python, as a result of one-and-half-year learning of the language

Objectives:
- generate a phonetic array based on each phoneme's features
  - not symbol based but feature based
- (sorta) difficult to use but effective once the setting is done

Todos:
- develop a parser
- involve a language's parameterinto the generation of words
- consider the process of generation of words and syllables
