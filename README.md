# WordGenerator
WORK IN PROGRESS.

"This has been my long interest."

I've just started to work on it since September, 2020 because I thought consciously defining the phonetical structure of words will definitely help me have deep insight regarding generative phonology.

...Plus I simply wanted to try out my skill of coding in Python, as a result of one-and-half-year learning of the language
